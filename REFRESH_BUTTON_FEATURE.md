# Refresh Button Feature

## Overview
Added a manual refresh/reconnect button to the WebSocket live prices implementation to allow users to force a reconnection when experiencing connection issues.

---

## 🔄 What Was Added

### 1. **Reconnect Function in Hook** (`src/hooks/use-crypto-price.ts`)

Added to the `useCryptoPrice` hook:
- `reconnect()` - Manual reconnection function
- `lastConnected` - Timestamp of last successful connection
- `forceReconnect` - Internal state to trigger reconnection

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { prices, isConnected, reconnect, lastConnected } = useCryptoPrice(symbols);

// Call reconnect when needed
reconnect();
```

### 2. **Refresh Button UI** (`src/app/(admin)/live-prices/page.tsx`)

Added refresh button in two locations:

#### A. Header Section
- Always visible refresh button with loading state
- Shows "Reconnecting..." with spinning icon during reconnection
- Displays last connected time

#### B. Connection Status Card
- Refresh button appears when disconnected
- Provides quick access to reconnect
- Icon-only button to save space

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### **Header Refresh Button**
```tsx
<Button 
  onClick={handleReconnect} 
  disabled={isReconnecting}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
>
  <RefreshCw className={isReconnecting ? 'animate-spin' : ''} />
  {isReconnecting ? 'Reconnecting...' : 'Refresh Connection'}
</Button>
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Spinning animation during reconnection
- ✅ Disabled state while reconnecting
- ✅ Text changes to show status
- ✅ Always visible for easy access

### **Connection Status Info**
```tsx
{lastConnected && (
  <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    Connected since: {lastConnected.toLocaleString()}
  </p>
)}
```

**Shows:**
- ✅ When connection was established
- ✅ How long connection has been active
- ✅ Helps monitor connection stability

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **How Reconnect Works**

1. **User clicks Refresh button**
   ```typescript
   handleReconnect() → setIsReconnecting(true) → reconnect()
   ```

2. **Hook clears state and triggers reconnection**
   ```typescript
   reconnect() → {
     setPrices({})              // Clear old prices
     setError(null)             // Clear errors
     setForceReconnect(prev => prev + 1)  // Trigger useEffect
   }
   ```

3. **useEffect closes old connection and creates new one**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Close existing WebSocket
     if (ws) ws.close();
     
     // Create new WebSocket connection
     ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
     // ... setup handlers
   }, [symbolsKey, forceReconnect])
   ```

4. **Connection re-established**
   ```typescript
   ws.onopen = () => {
     setIsConnected(true)
     setLastConnected(new Date())  // Update timestamp
   }
   ```

## 💡 Use Cases

### **When to Use Refresh Button?**

1. **Network Issues** - After WiFi reconnection or network switch
2. **Connection Drops** - When auto-reconnect fails
3. **Stale Data** - Prices not updating for extended period
4. **After Sleep/Hibernate** - When computer wakes from sleep
5. **Manual Testing** - To verify connection is working

### **User Flow**

```
User notices prices not updating
        ↓
Sees "Disconnected" status
        ↓
Clicks "Refresh Connection" button
        ↓
Button shows "Reconnecting..." with spin animation
        ↓
WebSocket reconnects
        ↓
Prices start updating again
        ↓
Status shows "Connected" with timestamp
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### **For Users**
- ✅ **Control** - Manual reconnect when auto-reconnect fails
- ✅ **Visibility** - See when connection was last established
- ✅ **Fast Recovery** - Immediate reconnection without page reload
- ✅ **Confidence** - Know connection is active and working

### **For Developers**
- ✅ **Debugging** - Easy to test reconnection logic
- ✅ **Monitoring** - Track connection stability via timestamp
- ✅ **Reliability** - Fallback when auto-reconnect fails
- ✅ **UX** - Better user experience with manual control

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before (Auto-reconnect only)**
```
Connection drops → Wait 3 seconds → Auto-reconnect
                     ↑
                  User waits, unsure if it will reconnect
```

### **After (With Refresh Button)**
```
Connection drops → User sees "Disconnected"
                → Clicks "Refresh Connection"
                → Immediate reconnection
                → Back to "Connected" in ~1 second
```

**Result**: Faster recovery and better user control!
