# User Role Management & Agent Portal - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All planned features have been successfully implemented. This document provides a comprehensive overview of what was built.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Three-Tier User Role System

The application now supports three distinct user roles:

- **ADMIN**: Full system access, can manage all users and assign agents
- **AGENT**: Can view and manage only assigned customers
- **CUSTOMER**: Standard customer access to their own portfolio

### 2. Admin Portal Enhancements

#### User Management Page (`/users`)

A comprehensive user management interface has been added to the admin portal:

- **Features:**
  - View all users in a searchable, filterable table
  - Search by name or email
  - Filter by role (All, Admin, Agent, Customer)
  - Real-time stats: Total users, Admins, Agents, Customers
  - Role badges with visual indicators
  - Customer count for agents

- **Actions:**
  - Change user role with confirmation dialog
  - Assign/unassign customers to agents
  - View portfolio status
  - View agent assignments for customers

#### Navigation Update

- Added "Users" menu item in the Management section
- Accessible from the admin sidebar

### 3. Agent Portal (`/agent/*`)

A complete agent portal has been created with the following pages:

- **Dashboard** (`/agent/dashboard`): Overview of assigned customers
- **Exchanges** (`/agent/exchanges`): View customer exchanges
- **Positions** (`/agent/positions`): Manage customer positions
- **Manual Trading** (`/agent/manual-trading`): Execute trades for customers
- **Signal Bot** (`/agent/signal-bot`): View and manage customer bots
- **Live Prices** (`/agent/live-prices`): Real-time cryptocurrency prices

#### Agent-Specific Features

- **Limited User Selector**: Only shows customers assigned to the agent
- **Dedicated Navigation**: Excludes user management features
- **Role-Based Access**: Agents can only access data for their assigned customers
- **Custom Dashboard**: Shows agent-specific statistics

### 4. Database Schema Updates

#### Prisma Schema Changes

```prisma
// Updated User model with agent-customer relationship
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // NEW: Agent-Customer relationship
  agentId   String? // Nullable - only set when customer is assigned to agent
  agent     User?   @relation("AgentCustomers", fields: [agentId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
  customers User[]  @relation("AgentCustomers") // Agent's assigned customers
}

// Updated UserRole enum
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  AGENT    // NEW
  CUSTOMER
}
```

## 📝 Files Modified

### Core Files
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added AGENT role and agentId field
- `src/lib/auth-utils.ts` - Added AGENT role type and isAgent() function
- `src/lib/navigation.ts` - Added Users menu item

---

## 🔄 User Flow

### Initial Setup

1. **New User Registration**
   - User signs up → Automatically assigned CUSTOMER role
   - Appears in admin's user list

2. **Admin Promotes User to Agent**
   - Admin navigates to `/users`
   - Finds the customer
   - Clicks "Change Role" → Selects "Agent"
   - User is now an agent

3. **Admin Assigns Customers to Agent**
   - Admin clicks "Assign Agent" on a customer
   - Selects agent from dropdown
   - Customer is now assigned to the agent

### Agent Login Flow

1. Agent logs in
2. Automatically redirected to `/agent/dashboard`
3. Sees only their assigned customers in the sidebar selector
4. Can manage those customers' trading activities

### Role-Based Redirects

When users visit the root URL (`/`):
- **ADMIN** → `/dashboard` (admin portal)
- **AGENT** → `/agent/dashboard` (agent portal)
- **CUSTOMER** → `/customer/dashboard` (customer portal)

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Route Protection

- **Admin Portal** (`/dashboard`, `/users`, etc.): Only accessible by ADMIN role
- **Agent Portal** (`/agent/*`): Only accessible by AGENT role
- **Customer Portal** (`/customer/*`): Only accessible by CUSTOMER role

### Data Isolation

- **Admins**: Can view and manage all users and customers
- **Agents**: Can only view/manage customers assigned to them
- **Customers**: Can only view their own data

### Database-Level Security

- Agent-customer relationship uses `onDelete: SetNull`
- If an agent is deleted, customers are automatically unassigned
- If agent role is changed, all assigned customers are unassigned

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_agent_role_and_assignments
```

See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### 2. Promote Initial Admin User

After migration, update your user to admin:

```sql
UPDATE "user" SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Test the Features

1. **Test Admin Functions**:
   - Login as admin
   - Visit `/users`
   - Change a user's role to AGENT
   - Assign customers to the agent

2. **Test Agent Functions**:
   - Login as the agent
   - Verify redirect to `/agent/dashboard`
   - Check that only assigned customers appear in selector
   - Try accessing admin portal (should be blocked)

3. **Test Role-Based Routing**:
   - Visit `/` as different roles
   - Verify correct redirects

## 🎨 UI Components Used

- **shadcn/ui components**:
  - Table, Card, Badge, Dialog, Select
  - DropdownMenu, Button, Input, ScrollArea
  - Sidebar components

- **Icons**: Lucide React (Users, Shield, UserCog, etc.)

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Login
    ↓
Role Check (getUserWithRole)
    ↓
Route-Based Redirect
    ↓
    ├── ADMIN → Admin Portal → All Customers
    ├── AGENT → Agent Portal → Assigned Customers Only
    └── CUSTOMER → Customer Portal → Own Data

Admin Actions:
    ├── Change Role → updateUserRole()
    └── Assign Agent → assignCustomerToAgent()

Agent Access:
    └── getAssignedCustomers() → Filter by agentId
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Self-Referencing User Relation**: Simplifies the schema (no separate AgentAssignment table)
2. **Client Components for UI**: Better UX with instant feedback
3. **Server Actions for Mutations**: Type-safe, secure data updates
4. **Separate Navigation Configs**: Clean separation between admin and agent portals
5. **Copied Pages for Agent Portal**: Ensures UI consistency while maintaining separation

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Navigation Configuration

The `NavigationProvider` automatically detects which navigation config to use based on the current path:
- Paths starting with `/agent` → Use agent navigation config
- All other paths → Use admin navigation config

This design ensures React components (icons) aren't passed from Server to Client Components, which is required in Next.js 15.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple customers to an agent at once
2. **Agent Permissions**: Granular permissions for what agents can do
3. **Customer Notifications**: Notify customers when assigned to an agent
4. **Agent Dashboard Analytics**: More detailed stats about agent performance
5. **Audit Log**: Track role changes and agent assignments
6. **Agent Workload Balancing**: Suggest agents with fewer customers
7. **Customer Search in Assignment**: Search customers when assigning to agent
